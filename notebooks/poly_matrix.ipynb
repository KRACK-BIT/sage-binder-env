    "     - This is as $(x - a) = 0 \\iff x = a$, so your polynomials just trivially resolve to a constant value in $\\mathbb{K}$\n",

    "     - LINK: This guarantee's connection to linear algebra, is that whilst a matrix $A$ will always have $n$ _generalized_ eigenvectors, its generalized eigenvalues are the roots of $\\chi_A(x)$ ($A$'s characteristic polynomial); but can these roots be expressed in $\\mathbb{K}$?\n",
    "       - Note that generalized eigenvectors != ordinary eigenvectors (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenvector>)\n",
